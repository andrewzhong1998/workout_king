#Workout King

This project aims to provide the advanced solution for people who want to keep track of their diet and weight. We have open-sourced the project, but gitignored sensitive files that include IP addresses, usernames, and passwords that can be used to make secure connections to our backend servers and databases.  

This project is built on Java Spring framework. Client and sever communicate through REST APIs. Structured users' data like account information are stored in a typical RDBMS - MySQL Database, while unstructured data like users' eating records are stored in NoSQL database - MongoDB. The Application is deployed on a remote Apache Tomcat server installed on AWS EC2.

This project is done by Andrew Zhong, Muyan Pgit an, and Jiayi Liu in collaboration.
